# premailer-api

Open pseudo implementation of http://premailer.dialect.ca/api.  This project follows that documentation.. mostly.

Added some files for running as a passenger app.  
## _important_ you'll need to edit .htaccess to suit your environment.

Forked from [bdavid/premailer-api](https://github.com/bdavid/premailer-api)

Master currently is an implementation for the company where I work.  This branch is to duplicate the api given by dialect.ca.  While dialect.ca (probably for good reason) disables some of the premailer options, this implementation does not.  That makes it useful for internal, but not really for public facing apis.  It's not a full duplication of the api, but it's in progress and somewhat workable
